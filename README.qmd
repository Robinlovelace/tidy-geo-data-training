title: Tidy geographic data with sf, dplyr, ggplot2, geos and friends

These materials were created for the OpenGeoHub Summer School 2023.

See the [parent repo](https://github.com/robinlovelace/opengeohub2023) and [session description in the agenda](https://pretalx.earthmonitor.org/opengeohub-summer-school-2023/talk/7JN3FV/) for context.

## Abstract


This lecture will provide an introduction to working with geographic data using R in a 'tidy' way.
It will focus on using the `sf` package to read, write, manipulate, and plot geographic data in combination with the `tidyverse` metapackage.
Why use the `sf` package with the `tidyverse`?
The lecture will outline some of the ideas underlying the `tidyverse` and how they can speed-up data analysis pipelines, while making data analysis code easier to read and write.
We will see how the following lines

```r
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```
can provide a foundation on which the many geographic data analysis problems can be solved.
The lecture will also cover on more recently developed packages that integrate with the `tidyverse` to a greater and lesser extent.
We will look at how the `geos` package, which provides a simple and high-performance interface to the GEOS library for performing geometric operations on geographic data, integrates with the `tidyverse`.
The `tidyverse` is not the right tool for every data analysis task and we touch on alternatives for working with raster data, with reference to the `terra` package, and alternative frameworks such as `data.table`.
Finally, we will also look at how the 'tidy' philosophy could be implemented in other programming languages, such as Python.

The focus throughout will be on practical skills and using packages effectively within the wider context of project management tools, integrated development environments (we recommend VS Code with appropriate extensions or RStudio), and version control systems.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the session, participants will be able to:

- Read, write, manipulate, and plot geographic data using the `sf` package
- Use the `tidyverse` metapackage to speed-up the writing of geographic data analysis pipelines
- Use the `geos` package to perform geometric operations on geographic data
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of the `tidyverse` for geographic data analysis
